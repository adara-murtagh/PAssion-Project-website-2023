            The JUICE mission launched on the 14th of April, 2023, one day late because of a lightning storm, by European Space Agency from Europe's Spaceport 
            in French Guiana, and launcher Ariane 5. It will travel to Jupiter, but not directly. To gather speed, it will make 3 planetary flybys. First, 
            it will complete the Lunar-Earth gravity assist for the first time, using the gravity of the moon and Earth at the same time, gaining speed. It 
            will fly to Venus, then back to Earth, each time using the gravity and orbit of the planet to gain speed without using as much fuel. It will then 
            fly to Jupiter’s biggest moon, Ganymede, to ease into Jupiter’s orbit in 2031. 
        </p>
        <p>
            JUICE will study in detail Jupiter and three of its biggest moons, Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa, which all have icy surfaces. Jupiter and its moons 
            are like a mini solar system, so understanding them will help scientists better understand the solar system as whole. The study will help scientists 
            better understand the conditions for planet formation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While they are not looking for life, the mission will help scientists answer the question of ‘is there life elsewhere?’ A main goal is to understand 
            whether there are habitable environments on the icy moons around a giant planet like Jupiter. The study will help scientists better understand the 
            conditions for the emergence of life. 
        </p>
        <p>
            JUICE will be the first spacecraft to orbit any moon other than ours. The moon it will orbit, Ganymede, is the biggest moon in our solar system, as 
            well as the only moon in our solar system to have a magnetic field. The mission will help uncover much important information in science.
