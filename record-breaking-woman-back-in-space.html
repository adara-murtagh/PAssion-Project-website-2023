            Peggy was born on the 9th of February 1960. She graduated from Rice University with a doctorate in biochemistry. She got her 
            first job at NASA in 1988, working in different NASA research positions based at the Johnson Space Centre.

            She was chosen to be an astronaut in 1996, but only went to space in 2002. She was a flight engineer on Endeavor, docking with 
            the ISS on the 7th of June, two days after the shuttle blasted away from Earth. While in space, she became the first NASA ISS 
            Science Officer, and completing a spacewalk. On her next spaceflight in 2007, she became the first female commander of the 
            International Space Station. In 2008, while returning from her trip to space, she crashed 470km away from the target. Thankfully, 
            she fully recovered. Peggy was the first non-military and first female chief of the Astronaut Office.

            When she next flew to space in 2016, she didn’t return until 289 days later, taking the record for longest time in one spaceflight 
            for a woman, a record she kept for three years. While in space, she completed 4 more spacewalks, breaking the record for the most 
            time on a spacewalk total for any woman. She also held the record for most time in space total of any American astronaut, as well 
            as the oldest female astronaut.

            When Peggy left NASA in 2018, she expressed her wishes to continue to pursue spaceflight. She said “I am not sure what the future 
            holds for me personally, but I envision myself continuing to work on spaceflight programs. My desire to contribute to the spaceflight 
            team as we move forward in our explanation of space has only increased over the years.” (Garcia, 2017) On the 21st of May 2023, she 
            blasted away from Earth yet again as commander of the Ax-2 mission. This mission was run by a private company called Axiom Space. This 
            marked her as the first female commander of a private space mission. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The mission was flown in SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule and launched from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Flying in 
            her crew was two members of Saudi Arabia's first astronaut class, Rayyanah Barnawi and Ali AlQarni, as well as the pilot, John Shoffner.

            It took the crew 1 day to travel to the ISS. They stayed there for 8 days, studying how cancer cells are formed in the zero-gravity 
            environment, helping scientists figure out how the cells form not only in space, but on our planet as well. They took a single day trip 
            back to Earth, landing on the 30th of May.
