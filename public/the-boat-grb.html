            The new Brightest Of All Time cosmic explosion, nicknamed the BOAT by scientists, was seen on October the 9th, 2022. It was 70 
            times brighter than the previous record holder and had an unusually long afterglow. Astronomers are only now, a year later, 
            beginning to understand the cause of such a massive explosion. It was originally called GRB 221009A, but nicknamed the BOAT 
            for its incredibly bright nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even before the BOAT was discovered, gamma ray bursts were already the most violent and powerful known explosion in the universe, 
            exerting more than our sun will in its lifetime. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The BOAT gamma ray burst, or GRB, probably came from a star 2.4 billion light-years away in the direction of the constellation 
            Sagitta going through complete gravitational collapse to form a black hole. The burst had a unique jet structure and had an 
            uncommonly large amount of stellar material tagging along for the ride, which might explain why it was so extreme, and why the 
            afterglow hung around for so long. The BOAT was so wide that initially astronomers could not see the edges.  
        </p>
        <p>
            “GRB jets need to go through the collapsing star in which they are formed, What we think made the difference in this case was 
            the amount of mixing that happened between the stellar material and the jet, such that shock-heated gas kept appearing in our 
            line of sight all the way up to the point that any characteristic jet signature would have been lost in the overall emission 
            from the afterglow.” (Lea, 2023) said co-author and Department of Physics at the University of Bath scientist Hendrik Van Eerten.

           "GRB 221009A represents a massive step forward in our understanding of gamma-ray bursts and demonstrates that the most extreme 
            explosions do not obey the standard physics assumed for garden variety gamma-ray bursts," (Lea, 2023) said George Washington 
            University researcher and study lead author Brendan O'Connor.
