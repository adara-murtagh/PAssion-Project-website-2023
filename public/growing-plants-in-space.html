            As we advance to be able to travel further into space, food becomes an issue. Bringing enough food for the journey to Mars or 
            even further takes up lots of space, and a lot of weight. It’s harder to make spacecraft big enough and strong enough to take 
            up all that food – and it would get boring for the astronauts very quickly. Seeds are much lighter and take up less space than 
            pre-prepared food. So, NASA and others are looking at how we can grow food in space without too much extra equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first step is picking the right plants to be tested. For this NASA has worked with schools across America in the “Growing 
            Beyond Earth” program. Students are trying to grow different plants in habitats similar to what is on the ISS. Plants that do 
            well in the classrooms are tested at NASA’s Kennedy Space Centre. Ones that thrive there are sent to be tested in the space 
            station, testing their growth in microgravity. 
        </p>
        <p>
            NASA has also tested future microgravity gardens, including the Vegetable Production System, or Veggie, which is made to be 
            hand-watered and cared for, with the seeds in little fabric pouches. Another method is Passive Orbital Nutrient Delivery System, 
            or Veggie PONDS, which work like the Veggie program, but instead of the pouches have automatic water and food dispensing parts. 
            The Veggie PONDS are made to study plant growth in space without the crew having to pay attention to the plants constantly.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Microgravity changes leaf development, plant cells, and the chloroplasts used in photosynthesis. However, as found in experiment 
            PESTO the plants were not harmed by this. Some plants even grew taller than on Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Growing plants in space is vital for long distance missions, such as to Mars.
