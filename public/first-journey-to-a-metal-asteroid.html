            It is the first mission to study an asteroid that is made of more metal than rock or ice. It is set to launch on the 13th of October, 
            2023 from Kennedy Space Centre. However, there is a window everyday at 1:38am AEDT. If it is missed one day, it can launch at this 
            time the following day. The spacecraft used is a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. The metal contained in the asteroid is worth, at current prices, 
            more money than there is on Earth in total. 
        </p>
        <p>
            However, understanding the asteroid could help scientists better understand how our solar system came to be. It will help us understand the iron 
            cores of planets like ours, something we have had trouble learning about in the past. 16 Psyche is suspected by scientists to be the exposed core 
            of a demolished planet, with up to 95% made of iron and nickel by mass, not unlike the core of Earth. 
        </p>
        <p>
            With the data gathered by the Psyche mission, scientist hope to figure out if 16 Psyche is actually a core, or unmelted material, as well as find 
            out what conditions 16 Psyche was formed under compared to Earth’s core. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Psyche spacecraft is outfitted with a Multispectral Imager, a Gamma Ray and Neutron Spectrometer, Magnetometer, and X-band Gravity Science 
            Investigation, as well as new laser communication technology. These lasers will encode data in photons, or light particles, at near-infrared 
            wavelengths, rather than radio waves, to communicate between a spacecraft deep in space, and us on Earth.
